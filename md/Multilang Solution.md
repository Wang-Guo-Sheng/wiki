Usually online wikis have parallel versions for different languages. Whatsoever, a personal wiki should focus on accuracy of each concept, which also means no two words in different languages should have exactly identical definitions. Therefore, it is a better solution to have all entries in different languages contained in //one// same wiki site while keeping track of the kinship between related concepts, i.e., to maintain a diagram where "corresponding" words in different languages are marked with their etymological relations etc..
